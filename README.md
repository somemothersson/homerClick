## HomerClick

A Click Game built in React that randomly renders a group of 9 images(each with a value between 1 and 3) on every click. On Load a random number between 1 and 3 will generated. 

### Instructions



* The application will render images of Homer Simpson to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

* The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image that matches the Random Number. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.

* When complete, the application will be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.
