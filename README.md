## HomerClick

A Memory Click Game built in React that randomly renders a group of 9 images. The app will remember the image chosen on every click and re-render all images randomly. Choose a previously unslected image to score points, if you choose an image you selected previously your score will be reset and you get to try again

### App functionality

![Game Play](./supplemental/homerClick.png)

* The application will render images of Homer Simpson to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

* The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image that matches the Random Number. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
